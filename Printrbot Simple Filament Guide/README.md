I copied Bixler's outline, but didn't use his files at all. I didn't want the pb logo, and I didn't want to use support
material either. I tried to remove the pb logo from his file, but I couldn't do it easily.

Instead, I started from scrath - its a nice easy project...

Using Inkscape, I created an outline.
I then exported the outline to scad file using an inkscape extension/plugin.
Extrude it in scad, removing the holes for the filament and the posts.

Each of my printers will have a name, starting with A for "Alice". So I need her name

Apply clear tape before removing from the bed, and then glue to the main part of the filament guide.
Remove tape when glue is dry.
